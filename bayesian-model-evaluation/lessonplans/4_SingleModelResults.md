# Section 4: Single model results visualization (35 mins)
Showcase how data visualizations can be using with Bayesian analysis to understand model and start building story around model results.

## Activities
“Fun” part: Show how models results can be visualized
Explain how to interpret each type of plot and common story elements that can told with each

### Instructor Do - Introduce following plots (15 minutes)
* Plot Posterior
* Plot Forest

Explain how the various plots visualize the distribution of parameters. 
After all with statistics and bayes there is no single answer, but rather a 
multitude of possible answers. Emphasize how posterior and forest plots
visualize model parameters, and posterior predictive plots generate estimations
of the actual data. Kernel Density Estimation is a technique to turn samples
into estimated density, but is particularly useful for MCMC because in MCMC
we don't have a mathematical distribution, but instead a count of samples.

### Students Do - Practice single model plotting (15 minutes)
Have students fit a two models and evaluate the parameters. 
Have students talk through the results with their partner to try and make
an inference about the results

### Instructor Do - Talk through results (5 minutes)
Go through results with students, explaining what they you noticed in the
model fits
